There is a few variants of configuration:
1) Via global config file: /etc/cgitrc
2) Or via local config file, shipped in ./conf dir into webapp_dir. It has to
be explicitly specified with CGIT_CONFIG env variable into spawn-script

You need to modify config with the list of available
repositories. Look at the examples in the file by searching for
repo.path
