		From http://hjemli.net/git/cgit/about/:
		cgit is 
		* a cgi application implemented in C: it's basically (yet) another git
			command, used to generate html.
		* not forking: all git operations are performed by linking with libgit.a.
		* using a built-in cache: the generated html is stored on disk for the
			benefit of later requests.
		* fond of virtual urls - using PATH_INFO or modules like mod_rewrite makes
			cgit generate urls with few or no querystring parameters, e.g.
			http://hjemli.net/git/cgit/log/Makefile vs.
			http://hjemli.net/git?r=cgit&amp;p=log&amp;path=Makefile.
		* not too visual, but sometimes a bit of graphics can be justified.
		* open source - it is licensed under GPL v2.
		* maintained by Lars Hjemli, who is happy to receive patches, suggestions
		and bug reports.
