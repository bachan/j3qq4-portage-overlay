To start using mnogosearch you need configure database (create database user
account and database itself) and edit at least indexer.conf and search.htm so
that indexer and search.cgi could connect to database.

1.Fex for mysql database. Connect to database with root account and create user.

  mysql> GRANT ALTER, CREATE, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, DELETE, DROP, INSERT,
  LOCK TABLES, SELECT, UPDATE ON mnogosearch.* TO 'foo'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED
  BY 'bar';

  Now create database:

  mysqladmin -u foo -p create mnogosearch

2.Edit DBAdr in ${VHOST_ROOT}/mnogosearch/indexer.conf
  file to reflect your database user and password.

  After that run indexer with 
  "-d ${VHOST_ROOT}/mnogosearch/indexer.conf"
  option. You may wish to add alias into your ~/.bashrc:
  alias indexer="indexer -d ${VHOST_ROOT}/mnogosearch/indexer.conf"

3.Edit DBAdr in ${VHOST_ROOT}/mnogosearch/search.htm.

Run "indexer -d ${VHOST_ROOT}/mnogosearch/indexer.conf -Ecreate"
to create tables in database. After that add "Server http://www.foo.org"
parameter into indexer.conf and run indexer to index that server.

Point your browser to http://${VHOST_CGIBINDIR}/search.cgi ;)
