0. PHP CONFIGURATION

Make sure that both register_globals and safe_mode are turned OFF, 
at least for the VirtualHost(s) you will be using this at.

1. SETUP

- Setup SQL db with following permissions
	SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, ALTER

- Change ${MY_INSTALLDIR}/src/config.php
  as necessary to reflect your SQLdb and tinyDNS service.

- Log into VegaDNS for the first time to create the tables, and update the
  default login information by pointing your web browser to:

  http://${VHOST_HOSTNAME}/${VHOST_APPDIR}

  Next, you should edit "default_records" so that new domains have the proper
  SOA record, and that they have name servers, etc.  Once this is done, you
  can add or import a domain, then setup the data dumps in the next step.

- To install the update-data.sh script (currently located in the
  /usr/share/doc/${PF}), you will need to first edit the
  VEGADNS variable to point to the correct url.  You may also need to update
  the TINYDNSDIR variable if you used something other than /etc/tinydns.

  Try exectuting the update-data.sh shell script.  Once you confirm that
  this is working correctly, move update-data.sh to /usr/sbin/ and then
  add it to cron to run every 10 minutes or so, whatever is appropriate.
  You'll an entry to your crontab like so:

  # Update tinydns with VegaDNS data
  */10 * * * * /usr/sbin/update-data.sh

NOTE: If intend to run update_data.sh from an IP other than 127.0.0.1, then
you will need to add that IP to $trusted_hosts in config.php

Also See: /usr/share/doc/${PF}/INSTALL
